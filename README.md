# Stupid-Python

An extremely small project initially created out of the boredom of being in a country with limited internet, then the subsequent interest in finding what to do when such internet is not accessible.
Absolutely nothing special, mostly skills learned from various tutorials slapped together (The New Boston on Youtube, Codecademy).
I don't expect anyone to read this, but on the off chance you do just know it's going to suck. I am very much a beginner.

Cba putting any other info here so gl.
